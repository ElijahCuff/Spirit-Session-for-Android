> Demonstrates real EMF detector and othe means of spirit communication.


> Ditch the FAKES !       
>  Android device's do have the ability to read very small changes in environment using the in-built hardware sensors, like the EMF Sensor, Image Sensor, Microphone, Accelerometer and even on some devices the Humidity and Barometric Pressure Sensors. 

### Building   
• Download the required Audio Dictionary file and add it to the src/res/raw folder alongside the phonetics and dictionary files.

• Build as normal   
 
#### Notes     
• App has basic permission acceptance

### History
This application was designed as an educational project toward afterlife communication apps and their legitimacy for claims on usability.
   
### Initial Findings    
- Microphone, Unfortunately most operating systems on mobile will automatically remove any noise in an audio recording stream - this is automatic and usually can not be bypassed withou an external hardware module - for Paranormal investigation, it is important that the audio being recorded is in RAW formzt, this is because "ghosts" communicate on a frequency that we can not hear; most of these Auto Noise removal systems will remove any audio from the recording that is their for no reason - like inauditory noise.      

- Camera, Simmilar downfalls exist for the image sensor on smartphones, in particular the Infrared Filters on the camera lens make it near impossible to capture light that is outside the visisble range of humans eye's, it is believed that "ghosts" manifest in video's and photo's because they can appear in Non Visible light spectrums like IR Infrared; Filtering Non Visible light helps to improve photo quality but not very useful for Paranormal Research.      

- Spirit Boxes, The FM Radio is not accesible to develpers and therfore the FM Radio can not even be accessed axcept where the manufacturer has released specific drivers for a system build, this makes the Live FM Radio very hard to develop for on smartphones: ultimately this results in needing to use IP Radio Scanning - IP Radio Scanning is supposed to be just as effective as Local Radio scanning for Spirit Boxes, so this could be an avenue.      

- Spirit Box V2 ( Random Phonics ), Some Spirit boxes use a database of the 44 Phonics in english to create a random sequence of phonics - these sequences sometimes result in not only full words, but sometimes full sentences and coherant conversations.

- EMF, Even though smartphones have a built-in compass with magnetic field sensor, The stores are loaded with fake EMF Detectors; EMF can be messured on smartphones using the sensor, and that was the purpuse behind this project: to demonstrate that these applications do not need to be faked.

### What's In the App ?   
The app has, EMF + EVP + Random Phonics features.
